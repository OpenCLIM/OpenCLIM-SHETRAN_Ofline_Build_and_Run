# OpenCLIM-SHETRAN_Ofline_Build_and_Run

SHETRAN model inputs are available for download from other sources. These scripts can be used alongside those files to build and run SHETRAN simulations with full NFM/UDM compatibility for historical and future scenarios.

This data was collated using the following script:
"I:\SHETRAN_GB_2021\01_Scripts\Other\Collate SHETRAN Inputs for Model Publishing.py"

You should add in the historical data and static inputs and adapt a script to run these.
