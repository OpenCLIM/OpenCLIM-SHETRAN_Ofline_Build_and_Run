# OpenCLIM-SHETRAN_Offline_Build_and_Run

#### Ben Smith | 19/01/2024

## Summary
SHETRAN model inputs are available for download from other sources. These scripts can be used alongside those files to build and run SHETRAN simulations with full NFM/UDM compatibility for historical and future scenarios.

This code is similar, but not the same as the code that is used to run the workflows on DAFNI, though it will produce the same outputs (and has the same inputs).

Catchment 1001 is used as an example simulation.

Additional code for dealing with SHETRAN simulations and their outputs can be found here:
